# Shiny_examples
The dataset is collected from https://www.kaggle.com/darinhawley/us-2021-census-cities-populations-coordinates/version/1
I have created an interactive shiny app that has included the following functions:
1.allow the users to search for specific contents within the table.
2.the default setting of displayed rows is 5 rows, but the users are allowed to change the number of displayed rows in the shiny app.
